1. I have finished the 《Grammar  Club》,I think this is a very useful book for me.  
2. I think chat in English is a very important thing to improve speaking skills(Not only with the native speaker,Anyone is OK, Just try to  open your mouth),I have find several partner to practice our speaking skill,But because the time zone problems,  we couldn't talk a lot,But I always appreciate them, My available time is from 1pm-2pm GMT (not everyday) and My Skype-ID is : cheney.mydream@gmail.com  
3. Recommending an app named "HiNative"(IOS version is available now),It is an amazing app, When you have any problems ,you can ask the native people on it. They will help you as soon as possible(But, Please notice the time difference)
