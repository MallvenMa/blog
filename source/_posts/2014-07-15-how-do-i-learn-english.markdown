1. I have changed my phone language and computer language to english  
2. I use Quora,Mashable,News Digest,Reddit,BuzzFeed everyday(also weibo and wechat ...)  
3. I use kindle to read novels everyday,I started from 《The little princle》haha, and now I am reading my sixth english book 《The Notebook》  
4. I get up at 6:00 am everyday to read after the "ESL Podcast"  
5. I also like watching  "TED" ,"Friends" and other american dramas (without subtitle)  
6. In order to improve my writing ability ,I am reading the 《Grammar Club》now   

update:  

1. I have finished the 《Grammar  Club》,I think this is a very useful book for me.  
2. I think chat with English is very important thing(Not only with the native speaker,Anyone is OK, Just open mouth,It is a big thing),I have find several partner to practice our speaking skill,But because the time difference we couldn't talk a lot,But I always thank them, My available time is from 1pm-2pm GMT (not everyday) and My Skype-ID is : cheney.mydream@gmail.com  
3. Recommending an app named "HiNative"(Ios version is available now),It is a amazing app,If you have any problems ,you can ask the native people on HiNative.They will help you as soon as possible(But, Please notice the time difference)
